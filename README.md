# Gok (boiler)

## Gok Introduction

`Gok` is a command line based tool to allow [Golang](https://golang.org) developers to create a `project`, within which `golang` services and gateways can be written and configured for deployment to Google's Cloud Platform ([GCP](https://cloud.google.com)), specifically [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).

The intention is to consolidate [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) configuration for services into a single convention. The aim is to encourage teams to use a single convention to increase productivity and decrease learning curve for new team members.

## Boiler Introduction

This repo defines the implementation for the `boiler` subsystem of Gok.
This repo is used as the template for new projects when they are created using the `gok g <project_pathname>` command.

*NOTE:*
This `README.md` will be copied to your new project, so you should replace with your contents before initial commit to GitHub (or you Git repository of choice).
